					<p> To most beginner technical writers, typeface (also referred to as “font”) can seem insignificant. I know a few years ago, I could care less about typography. Whether it was a brochure, poster design, or website— I immediately went with the default typefaces on my computer like Times New Roman, Cambria, or Arial. I used to think, like most people, all typefaces are essentially the same. However, today, I’m going to tell you why typeface choice is so significant in design. </p> <br>

					<h3>The Basics</h3>
					<p>Whether you realize it or not, every typeface has a different personality. Therefore, they have the ability to convey different feelings and moods. Typefaces can evoke strength, elegance, agitation, silliness, friendliness, scariness, and other moods. Let’s take a look at some examples to see what I mean: </p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row" id="work-format">
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<img src="tnr.png" id="work-image1"/> <br>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<img src="curlz.png" id="work-image1"/><br>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<img src="impact.png" id="work-image1"/><br>
			</div>
		</div> <br> <br>

		<div class="row" id="top"> <!--Navegation bar-->
			<div class="col-md-12">
					<p> Because each typeface comes with a personality, typefaces can influence your interpretation of the words you are reading. To illustrate this concept, lets look at another example: </p><br>
			</div>
    </div>

		<div class="row" id="work-format">
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<img src="burger.png" id="work-image1"/> <br> <br>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row" id="top">
			<div class="col-md-12">
					<p> These are the same words, yet the typefaces give them both completely different meanings. The font on the left makes “Burger” looks cheap and mass produced. The font on the right makes “Burger” look modern, fresh, and more expensive. Although they are both the same word, the typeface influences how we interpret them. </p> <br>
					<h3> Rhetorical Value</h3>
					<p>Now that we know that typefaces possess personality, and they can influence our interpretation of words. This means that, no matter the context, they can help you accomplish your purpose; hence, they have rhetorical value. Selecting a typeface is like getting dressed. Just as one chooses an outfit according to the occasion, one decides on a typeface according to the kind of message you are trying to convey. Let’s look at an example:</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row" id="work-format">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<img src="buffy1.jpg" id="work-image"/> <br>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<img src="buffy2.jpg" id="work-image"/> <br> <br>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row" id="top">
			<div class="col-md-12">
					<p> Here is a poster for a popular television show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Immediately, you see a dark purple, chaotic background with Buffy holding a sharp stake in the foreground. Both convey a sense of intensity and eeriness. </p> <br>
					<p>Now let’s decide which typeface best fits. On the left, is plain san-serif typeface, which sends off a very ordinary, clean, and professional feeling. However, the sharp and angular-shaped typeface on the right gives off a feeling of mystery, power, and creepiness. The typeface on the right clearly fits the rhetorical situation; it conveys the same feelings as the poster design itself. Making the design effective, and more engaging for the viewer. </p> <br>
					<h3> Moving Forward</h3>
					<p>As technical writers, you will be in many situations where you will have to choose a typeface. You could be designing a website, brochure, poster, etc. Therefore, think carefully before you chose a typeface. Consider your rhetorical situation and consider which typeface is appropriate. Think: what is the purpose of the project? What type of feelings am I trying to evoke? If you keep this in mind, you will convey your rhetorical intentions effectively, creating a persuasive and effective document.</p> <br> <br>
